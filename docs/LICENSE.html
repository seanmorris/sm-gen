        <p>“Legal Entity” shall mean the union of the acting entity and
        all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under
        common control with that entity. For the purposes of this
        definition, “control” means (i) the power, direct or indirect,
        to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by
        contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%)
        or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership
        of such entity.</p>

        <p>“Object” form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
        transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
        not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
        and conversions to other media types.</p>

        or Object form, made available under the License, as indicated
        by a copyright notice that is included in or attached to the
        work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).</p>
        <p>“Derivative Works” shall mean any work, whether in Source or
        Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for
        which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or
        other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of
        authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works
        shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely
        link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and
        Derivative Works thereof.</p>
        <p>“Contribution” shall mean any work of authorship, including
        the original version of the Work and any modifications or
        additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is
        intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by
        the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity
        authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the
        purposes of this definition, “submitted” means any form of
        electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the
        Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
        communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control
        systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on
        behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and
        improving the Work, but excluding communication that is

        copyright owner as “Not a Contribution.”</p>
        <p>“Contributor” shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal
        Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by
        Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.</p>
        <h3 id="grant-of-copyright-license.">2. Grant of Copyright
        License.</h3>
        <p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each
        Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,
        non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright
        license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly
        display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work
        and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.</p>
        <h3 id="grant-of-patent-license.">3. Grant of Patent
        License.</h3>
        <p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each
        Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,
        non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as
        stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use,
        offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
        where such license applies only to those patent claims
        licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by
        their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their
        Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was
        submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity
        (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging
        that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work
        constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any
        patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work
        shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.</p>
        <h3 id="redistribution.">4. Redistribution.</h3>
        <p>You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or
        Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
        modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
        meet the following conditions:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative
        Works a copy of this License; and</li>
        <li>You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
        stating that You changed the files; and</li>
        <li>You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding
        those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative
        Works; and</li>
        <li>If the Work includes a “NOTICE” text file as part of its
        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of
        the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as
        part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do
        not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices
        within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an
        addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such
        additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying
        the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your
        modifications and may provide additional or different license
        terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of
        Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,
        provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work
        otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this
        License.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="submission-of-contributions.">5. Submission of
        Contributions.</h3>
        <p>Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution
        intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the
        Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this
        License, without any additional terms or conditions.
        Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or
        modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have
        executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</p>
        <h3 id="trademarks.">6. Trademarks.</h3>
        <p>This License does not grant permission to use the trade
        names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the
        Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in
        describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of
        the NOTICE file.</p>
        <h3 id="disclaimer-of-warranty.">7. Disclaimer of Warranty.</h3>
        <p>Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing,
        Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its
        Contributions) on an “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR
        CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including,
        without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE,
        NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
        PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
        appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume
        any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under
        this License.</p>
        <h3 id="limitation-of-liability.">8. Limitation of
        Liability.</h3>
        <p>In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort
        (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required
        by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent
        acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable
        to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
        incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as
        a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use
        the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of
        goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any
        and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such
        Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such
        damages.</p>
        <h3 id="accepting-warranty-or-additional-liability.">9.
        Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.</h3>
        <p>While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof,
        You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of
        support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations
        and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in
        accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf
        and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other
        Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and
        hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or
        claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your
        accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</p>
