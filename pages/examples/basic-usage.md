# Basic Usage Example

This example walks through a minimal setup of the static-site generator in a new project directory.

## Setup

Create a project folder and a `pages/` subdirectory:

```bash
mkdir my-site
cd my-site
mkdir pages
```

## Create your first page

Add `pages/index.md` with front-matter and Markdown content:

```markdown
---
title: Hello, Static Site!
---

# Hello, Static Site!

This is your first page generated by the static site generator.
```

## Build the site

Run the build script (from your project root):

```bash
smgen build
```

Open `docs/index.html` in your browser to view the generated page.
