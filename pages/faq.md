# FAQ & Troubleshooting

### Q: I get an error "php is required."?

Ensure PHP CLI is installed and `php` is on your PATH.

### Q: I get an error "pandoc is required."?

Ensure Pandoc is installed and `pandoc` is on your PATH.

### Q: I get yq: Error running jq: ParserError: did not find expected &lt;document start&gt;

You've got `jq` installed, and it's aliased to `yq`. You need the actual `yq` binary:

```bash
YQ_VERSION=v4.47.2
wget -qO /usr/local/bin/yq https://github.com/mikefarah/yq/releases/download/${YQ_VERSION}/yq_linux_amd64
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/yq
```

### Q: I get an error "uuid is required."?

Ensure `uuid` is installed and on your PATH.

### Q: I get strange YAML errors on pages with no frontmatter?

There seems to be a bug somewhere in the stack when the Markdown file uses `---` for horizontal rules (`<hr />` tags). You can work around this issue by using the equivalent `***` notation to achieve the same end result.

### Q: Front-matter isn't being applied?

Check that your YAML block is enclosed between triple dash (`---`) markers at the top of the file.

Ensure there are no characters before or after the `---` on those lines, and that the first line in the file is `---`.

### Q: Custom CSS/JS not loading?

Verify your `STYLES` or `JAVASCRIPTS` variables and correct paths in `.smgen-rc`.

### Q: smgen watch fails or is unavailable?

The `smgen watch` command relies on the Linux `inotify-tools` package for filesystem events. On systems without `inotify-tools` support (e.g., macOS), the watcher is not available. You can still use `smgen serve` and manually rebuild with `smgen build`, or install `inotify-tools` on Linux (`apt install inotify-tools`, `dnf install inotify-tools`, `pacman -S inotify-tools`).

### Q: How do I install the PHP YAML extension?

Make sure the PHP YAML extension is installed so that SMGen can parse YAML front-matter. On most Linux distros install the `php-yaml` package (e.g., `apt install php-yaml`, `dnf install php-yaml`, `pacman -S php-yaml`). On macOS, use shivammathur's taps:

```bash
brew tap shivammathur/php
brew tap shivammathur/extensions
brew install shivammathur/extensions/yaml@<php-version>
```

### Q: Why isn't my search updating?

1) Ensure `smgen-search` is installed:

```bash
npm i -g smgen-search
```

2) Run the following in the root of the project:

```bash
smgen-search build-index ./pages static/search.bin
smgen build
```

### Q: The `smgen proofread` command throws an error

#### Error: The file "./aspell.txt" is not in the proper format.

Make sure your aspell dictionary  (`ASPELL_DICT`, default `./aspell.txt`) has a valid header on the first line:

```bash
personal_ws-1.1 en utf8
```

#### "The character 'ï¿½' (U+XX) may not appear in the middle of a word." ?

You've got unicode in your aspell dict without specifying it in the header.

Make sure your aspell dictionary has `utf8` as the last element of the FIRST line:

```bash
personal_ws-1.1 en utf8
```

### Other Tips

- Use `set -x` in `smgen` to debug build steps.
- Ensure `yq` version supports `--front-matter=extract`.
